# Potato Leaf Disease Classification - Backend and Machine Learning

This repository contains the backend and machine learning code for the **Potato Leaf Disease Classification** project. The backend is built using **Flask** or **FastAPI**, and the machine learning model is built using **TensorFlow/Keras**.

---

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses a pre-trained model for classifying potato leaf diseases.
- **API**: A REST API to interact with the model, receiving image input and returning classification results.
- **Flask/FastAPI Backend**: Lightweight web framework to expose the ML model to the frontend.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)

---

## Installation
